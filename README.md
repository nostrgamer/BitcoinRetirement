# Bitcoin Retirement Calculator

A web application that visualizes Bitcoin price against the Power Law model to help with retirement planning decisions.

## Features

- **Real-time Bitcoin Price**: Fetches current Bitcoin price from CoinGecko API
- **Power Law Model**: Calculates Bitcoin's "fair value" using the power law formula
- **Interactive Chart**: Displays both actual Bitcoin price and power law model over time
- **Price Analysis**: Shows whether Bitcoin is currently above or below fair value
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Privacy & Data Storage

**ðŸ”’ Your Privacy is Protected**

- **No User Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or user tracking of any kind
- **No Personal Data**: The app doesn't collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- **Works Offline**: Once loaded, the app works without internet (except for live price updates)
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - you can verify the code yourself

**What Data is Used:**
- Historical Bitcoin price data (included in the app, publicly available)
- Current Bitcoin price (fetched from CoinGecko API for display only)
- Your inputs (Bitcoin holdings, expenses) - processed locally, never transmitted

**Your financial information stays on your device and is never shared.**

# Power Law Mode

The app uses the Bitcoin Power Law model which suggests that Bitcoin's price follows a mathematical relationship with time:

```
Price = A Ã— (days_since_genesis)^B
```

Where:
- A â‰ˆ 10^-15.5 (coefficient)
- B â‰ˆ 5.84 (exponent)
- days_since_genesis is calculated from Bitcoin's genesis block (January 3, 2009)
